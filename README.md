Introducing <strong>Combat Mode</strong> – an AddOn designed to bring a more dynamic action combat experience to <em>World of Warcraft</em> by implementing Free Look, Reticle Targeting, casting with mouse clicks, and more!
</center>

<p align="center">
With a full suite of carefully programmed changes <strong>aimed at breathing some much-needed life into WoW's tab-targeting combat</strong>, Combat Mode introduces features like <ins>Free Look</ins>, allowing you to change your character’s facing direction by moving the mouse without needing to perpetually hold right-click. When enabled - either through a <em>toggle</em> or <em>press & hold</em> key bind - the cursor is locked to the center of the screen and transformed into a <ins>reticle capable of target selection</ins>, even supporting the use of <em>@cursor</em> or <em>@mouseover</em> macros.
</center>
<p align="center">
Combat Mode takes it further by allowing you to <ins>cast spells with mouse clicks</ins>, a mechanic inspired by third-person action games. For convenience, the AddOn will <ins>automatically deactivate Free Look while interacting with a range of interface panels</ins>, reactivating it once closed. Additionally, you can expand this list of panels.

Experience <em>World of Warcraft</em> like never before with <strong>Combat Mode</strong>!

- [Free Look](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_look) - Rotate the player character's view with the camera without having to perpetually hold right click.
- Reticle Targeting - Enable users to target units by simply aiming the reticle at them, as well as allowing proper use of @mouseover and @cursor macro decorators in combination with the crosshairs.
- Optional adjustable dynamic Crosshair marker to assist with Reticle Targeting.
- Mouse Click Casting - When Free Look is enabled, frees your mouse clicks so you can cast up to 8 skills with them.
- Cursor Unlock - Automatically releases the cursor when opening interface panels like bags, map, character panel, etc.
