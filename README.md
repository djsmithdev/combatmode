CombatMode aims to emulate a more dynamic action combat experience in World of Warcraft by adding [Free Look (also known as mouselook)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_look), reticle targeting, ability casting with clicks, and more, without compromising your ability to play competitively.

<br />

## <img width="32" height="32" src="./cmlogo.svg">Features
- [Free Look](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_look) - Move your camera without having to perpetually hold right mouse button.
- Reticle Targeting - Makes use of the SoftTarget methods added with DF to allow the user to target units by aiming at them.
- Optional adjustable Crosshair texture to assist with Reticle Targeting.
- Mouse Button Keybinds - When Free Look is enabled, frees your mouse clicks so you can cast up to 8 skills with them.
- Cursor Unlock - Automatically releases the cursor when opening interface panels like bags, map, character panel, etc.
