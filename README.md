<p align="center">
With a full suite of carefully programmed changes inspired by <ins>Guild Wars 2's Action Camera</ins> - <strong>all aimed at breathing some much-needed life into WoW's tab-targeting combat</strong> - Combat Mode introduces features like <ins>Free Look</ins>, allowing you to change your character’s facing direction by moving the mouse without needing to perpetually hold right-click. When enabled - either through a <em>toggle</em> or <em>press & hold</em> key bind - the cursor is locked to the center of the screen and transformed into a <ins>reticle capable of target selection</ins>, even supporting the use of <em>@cursor</em> or <em>@mouseover</em> macros.
</center>
<p align="center">
Combat Mode takes it further by allowing you to <ins>cast spells with mouse clicks</ins>, a mechanic inspired by third-person action games. For convenience, the AddOn will <ins>automatically deactivate Free Look while interacting with a range of interface panels</ins>, reactivating it once closed.

Experience <em>World of Warcraft</em> like never before with <strong>Combat Mode</strong>!
