CombatMode aims to emulate a more dynamic action combat experience in World of Warcraft by implementing [Free Look](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_look), reticle targeting, skill casting with left/right click, and more, without compromising your ability to play competitively.

<br />

## <img width="32" height="32" src="./cmlogo.svg">Features
- [Free Look](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_look) - Rotate the player character's view with the camera without having to perpetually hold right click.
- Reticle Targeting - Utilizes SoftTarget methods from DF enabling users to target units by simply aiming at them.
- Optional adjustable dynamic Crosshair marker to assist with Reticle Targeting.
- Mouse Button Keybinds - When Free Look is enabled, frees your mouse clicks so you can cast up to 8 skills with them.
- Cursor Unlock - Automatically releases the cursor when opening interface panels like bags, map, character panel, etc.
